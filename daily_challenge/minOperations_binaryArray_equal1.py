'''You are given a

nums.

You can do the following operation on the array any number of times (possibly zero):

    Choose any 3 consecutive elements from the array and flip all of them.

Flipping an element means changing its value from 0 to 1, and from 1 to 0.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,0]

Output: 3

Explanation:
We can do the following operations:

    Choose the elements at indices 0, 1 and 2. The resulting array is nums = [1,0,0,1,0,0].
    Choose the elements at indices 1, 2 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0].
    Choose the elements at indices 3, 4 and 5. The resulting array is nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1,1]

Output: -1

Explanation:
It is impossible to make all elements equal to 1.
